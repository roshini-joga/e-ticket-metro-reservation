# e-ticket-metro-reservation
This whole system is based on a concept to reserve train tickets of various destinations.
We designed this project because, at times like COVID-19. It would be way too much difficult to stand in the queue for the ticket and taking the risk of COVID-19 safety measures. 
, as the program is executed, thereâ€™s a registration system then the user has to choose between reserving a ticket, viewing all the available trains , cancel the metro ticket with refund,displaying the registered users,changing the day of boarding. By 
choosing reservation of ticket, user has to enter the name, number of tickets and then choose by which train to travel according to their destination. Then the system will ask for ticket confirmations. User can also view full list of all the trains available. After reserving a metro ticket you can also cancel your reservation.
